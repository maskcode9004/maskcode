- **Projected Revenue for ZX-1000 (E)**: 1,980.00 million yen
- **Recall Cost per Unit**: 8,000 yen
- **Reduction Rate**: 25%

### Calculations

1. **Calculate the number of units sold subject to recall (NR)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Calculate the sales price of the model subject to recall (P)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980,000,000}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980,000,000}{31,680} \approx 62,600 \text{ yen/unit}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total recall cost (X)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,240,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

4. **Calculate total planned sales volume considering the reduction rate (N)**:
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = (27,720 + 3,960) \times 0.75 = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Calculate the decrease in revenue (Y)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,600 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 62,600 \times 7,920 \approx 494,352,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total loss amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 494,352,000 \approx 588,592,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Calculate the revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E')**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 588,592,000 \approx 1,391,408,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

8. **Calculate the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 588,592,000 \approx 2,183,408,000 \text{ yen}

Please let me know if you need any further assistance!","To fill in the simulation based on the provided sales plan and conditions, we will calculate each value step by step.

### Initial Values from the Sales Plan:
- \( A = 15,840 \) (Production volume in 2023)
- \( B = 27,720 \) (Production plan volume for 2024)
- \( C = 3,960 \) (Domestic inventory as of the end of April 2024)
- \( D = 2,772.00 \) million yen (Projected revenue for this fiscal year)
- \( E = 1,980.00 \) million yen (Planned revenue for the model subject to recall)

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Calculate the Number of Units Sold Subject to Recall \( NR \)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880
   \]

2. **Calculate the Sales Price of the Model Subject to Recall \( P \)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980.00 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980.00 \text{ million yen}}{31,680} \approx 62.539 \text{ thousand yen}
   \]
   To express in yen: 
   \[
   P \approx 62,539 \text{ yen}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Recall Cost \( X \)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,240,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Post-recall Sales Volume \( N \)**:
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = (27,720 + 3,960) \times 0.75 = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760
   \]

5. **Calculate the Decrease in Revenue \( Y \)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,539 \times 31,680 \times 0.25
   \]
   Calculating the full term:
   \[
   Y \approx 62,539 \times 31,680 = 1,984,800 \text{ thousand yen} \Rightarrow Y \times 0.25 \approx 496,200 \text{ thousand yen} = 496.200 \text{ million yen}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Loss Amount \( L \)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y \approx 94,240,000 + 496,200,000 \approx 590,440,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Calculate the Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall \( E' \)**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980.00 - \left(\frac{590,440,000}{1,000,000}\right) = 1,980.00 - 590.44 \approx 1,389.56 \text{ million yen}
   \]

8. **Calculate the Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year \( D' \)**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772.00 - \left(\frac{590,440,000}{1,000,000}\right) = 2,772.00 - 590.44 \approx 2,181.56 \text{ million yen}

6. **Calculate the Total Loss Amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 493,750,000 = 587,990,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Calculate Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall (E')**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 587,990,000 = 1,392,010,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

8. **Calculate Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D')**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 587,990,000 = 2,184,010,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

This concludes the simulation based on the provided conditions.","Let's fill in the blanks step by step based on the provided sales plan and conditions for the ZX-1000 model.

**Step 1: Calculate NR (Number of Units Sold Subject to Recall)**
\[
NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate P (Sales Price of the Model Subject to Recall)**
\[
P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980.00 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980,000,000}{31,680} \approx 62,475.69 \text{ yen/unit} 
\]

**Step 3: Calculate X (Total Recall Cost)**
\[
X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate N (Post-Recall Sales Volume)**
\[
N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = (27,720 + 3,960) \times 0.75 = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate Y (Decrease in Revenue)**
\[
Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,475.69 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \approx 493,0.89 \times 7,920 = 493,016,495.94 \text{ yen} \approx 493.02 \text{ million yen}
\]

**Step 6: Calculate L (Loss Amount)**
\[
L = X + Y = 95,040,000 + 493,016,495.94 \approx 588,056,495.94 \text{ yen} \approx 588.06 \text{ million yen}
\]

**Step 7: Calculate Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall, E'**
\[
E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 588,056,495.94 \approx 1,391,943,504.06 \text{ yen} \approx 1,391.94 \text{ million yen}
\]

**Step 8: Calculate Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year, D'**
\[
D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 588,056,495.94 \approx 2,183,943,504.06 \text{ yen} \approx 2,183.94 \text{ million yen}
\]

This should provide a comprehensive simulation based on the conditions specified.","To fill in the blanks in the simulation based on the provided conditions, we will calculate each of the variables step by step.

### Given Information
- A (2023 Production Volume): **15,840 units**
- B (2024 Production Plan Volume): **27,720 units**
- C (Domestic Inventory as of the end of April 2024): **3,960 units**
- D (Projected Revenue for This Fiscal Year): **2,772 million yen**
- E (ZX-1000 Domestic Projected Revenue): **1,980 million yen**
- Recall cost per unit: **8,000 yen**
- Reduction rate: **25%**

### Calculations

1. **Units subject to recall (NR)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Sales price of the model subject to recall (P)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{31,680} \approx 62.5 \text{ thousand yen/unit}
   \]
   (Converting to yen: 62,500 yen)

3. **Total recall cost (X)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,240,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

4. **Post-recall sales volume (N)**:
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = (27,720 + 3,960) \times 0.75 = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Decrease in revenue (Y)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,500 \text{ yen/unit} \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \approx 62,500 \times 7,920 = 493,750,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

6. **Loss amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 493,750,000 = 587,990,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E')**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 587,990,000 \approx 1,392,010,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

8. **Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 587,990,000 \approx 2,184,010,000 \text{ yen}
   \]
