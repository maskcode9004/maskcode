29338,"When a person aged 39 is added to a group of n people, the average age increases by 2. When a person aged 15 is added instead, the average age decreases by 1. What is the value of R?","['7', '8', '9', '10', '11']","A simple and elegant solution.
As addition of 39, shifts mean by 2, and addition of 15, shifts mean by 1 to the other side, we have the mean lying between 3915, and in a ratio of 2:1
39-15 = 24
24 divide by 3 is 8.
Meaning mean of the n terms is 15+8 = 39-16 = 23
Now, from first statement, When a person aged 39 is added to a group of n people, the average age increases by 2.
R*23 +39 = 25*(R+1)
R = 7

Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).

Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)
