Since co-efficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola will be downward facing. So the parabola and the x axis will enclose some points where the y-values of the parabola are positive.
When x = 1, y = 5 lies on the parabola, so (1, 6) will not be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.
When x = 3, y = 9 lies on the parabola, so (3, 11) will not be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.
When x = 5, y = 5 lies on the parabola, so (5, 4) will be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.

## Text
Since co-efficient of <r024> is negative, the parabola will be downward facing. So the parabola and the x axis will enclose some <r016> where the y-values of the parabola are <r017>.
When x = 1, y = 5 lies on the parabola, so (1, 6) will not be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.
When x = 3, y = 9 lies on the parabola, so (3, 11) will not be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.
When x = 5, y = 5 lies on the parabola, so (5, 4) will be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.

- Respond in JSON format as {'basis': str, 'answer': int}
- Use only the text as a reference for the basis

## Text
A simple and elegant solution.
As addition of 39, shifts mean by 2, and addition of 15, shifts mean by 1 to the other side, we have the mean lying between 3915, and in a ratio of 2:1
39-15 = 24
24 divide by 3 is 8.
Meaning mean of the n terms is 15+8 = 39-16 = 23
Now, from first statement, When a person aged 39 is added to a group of n people, the average age increases by 2.
R*23 +39 = 25*(R+1)
R = 7

A simple and elegant solution.
As addition of 39, shifts mean by 2, and addition of 15, shifts mean by 1 to the other side, we have the mean lying between 3915, and in a <r023> of 2:1
39-15 = 24
24 divide by 3 is 8.
Meaning mean of the n terms is 15+8 = 39-16 = 23
Now, from first statement, When a person aged 39 is added to a group of n people, the average age increases by 2.
<r022>*23 +39 = 25*(<r022>+1)
<r022> = 7

There's a lot of information given here, so let's eat slow here.
Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).
Now, come next year, or his second year at this psychology school, he's technically 23 years old. To find out the second year's grade, we want to double his age PLUS half of his previous grade.
Well, his second year is then going to be 23(2) + 22 = 68.
Now let's tackle the main question: what's his grade going to be the third year?
Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)

Cool question!
There's a lot of information given here, so let's eat slow here.
Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).
Now, come next year, or his second year at this psychology school, he's technically 23 years old. To find out the second year's grade, we want to double his age PLUS half of his previous grade.
Well, his second year is then going to be 23(2) + 22 = 68.
Now let's tackle the main question: what's his grade going to be the third year?
Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)

When it comes to averages, we know thataverage value = (sum of n values)/n
We can rewrite this into a useful formula:sum of n values = (average value)(n)
The average of five integers is 56
So, the sum of ALL 5 integers = (56)(5) =280
The average of three of the integers is 65
So, the sum of the 3 integers = (59)(3) =177
So, the sum of the 2 REMAINING integers =280-177=103
If the sum of the 2 REMAINING integers =103, and we want to minimize one value, we must MAXIMIZE the other value.
100 is the maximum value so let 1 integer = 100, which means the other must equal 3

## Text
When it comes to averages, we know <r024> <r026> = (sum of n <r026>s)/n
We can rewrite this into a useful formula:sum of n <r026>s = (average <r026>)(n)
The average of five integers is 56
So, the sum of ALL 5 integers = (56)(5) =280
The average of three of the integers is 65
So, the sum of the 3 integers = (59)(3) =177
So, the sum of the 2 <r020> integers =280-177=103
If the sum of the 2 <r020> integers =103, and we <r029> to <r015> one <r026>, we must MAXIMIZE the <r018> <r026>.
100 is the <r013> <r026> so let 1 integer = 100, which means the <r018> must equal 3

Twelve kilograms of oranges contained 98% of water. If the next day the concentration of water decreased by 2%, what was the new weight of the oranges, in kilograms?
(A) 6
(B) 4.8
(C) 2.5
(D) 2

If A is the answer, then the question means that the concentration of water the newt day became 96%.
Out of 12 kilograms 98%, or 11.76 kilograms was water and 0.24 kilograms was non-water.
The next day, after some water evaporated, oranges became 96% water and 4% of non-water, so the next day 0.24 kilograms of non-water composed 4% of oranges, which means that the new weight of the oranges was x*0.04=0.24 --> x=6 kilograms.

## Question
As a treat for her two children, a mother runs to the freezer in which she has three cherry ice pops, four orange ice pops, and five lemon ice pops. She chooses two at random to bring outside to the children, but realizes as she runs out the door that she cannot bring them different flavors without one being jealous of the other and getting even more upset. What is the probability that she has to return to the freezer to make sure that they each receive the same flavor?

## Question
In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the “number” of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different W sets can be produced by this process?

We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the “number” of the envelope. An envelope <r011> no cards <r019> the number 1. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from <r021> to highest, and that is our set. How many different W sets can be produced by this process?
