29338,"When a person aged 39 is added to a group of n people, the average age increases by 2. When a person aged 15 is added instead, the average age decreases by 1. What is the value of R?","['7', '8', '9', '10', '11']","A simple and elegant solution.
As addition of 39, shifts mean by 2, and addition of 15, shifts mean by 1 to the other side, we have the mean lying between 3915, and in a ratio of 2:1
39-15 = 24
24 divide by 3 is 8.
Meaning mean of the n terms is 15+8 = 39-16 = 23
Now, from first statement, When a person aged 39 is added to a group of n people, the average age increases by 2.
R*23 +39 = 25*(R+1)
R = 7

There's a lot of information given here, so let's eat slow here.
Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).
Now, come next year, or his second year at this psychology school, he's technically 23 years old. To find out the second year's grade, we want to double his age PLUS half of his previous grade.
Well, his second year is then going to be 23(2) + 22 = 68.
Now let's tackle the main question: what's his grade going to be the third year?
Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)
Having said that, the final answer would be 24(2) + 68/2 = 48 + 34 = 82 --> (C)",2,train.json,"Cool question!

## Question
In a certain <r016> <r001>, we have five <r003> with five <r006> prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five <r003> among three <r009>: all could go in any <r009>, or they could be broken up in any way among the <r009>s. Then in each envelop, we find the <r022> of all the <r003> in that <r009>: that is the “number” of the <r009>. An <r009> containing no <r003> has the number 1. We then put the three <r009> numbers in <r018>, from <r014> to <r013>, and that is our <r024>. How <r015> <r006> W <r024>s can be produced by this <r020>?
