Given:
- A (production volume in 2023): 15,840.00 units
- B (production plan volume for 2024): 27,720.00 units
- C (inventory volume as of April 2024): 3,960.00 units
- NR (number of units sold subject to recall): NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 units
- Planned revenue for the model subject to recall (E): 1,980.00 million yen

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Calculate the Recall Cost (X)**:
   - X = 8,000 yen * NR = 8,000 * 11,880 = 94,240,000 yen

2. **Calculate the Total Inventory for 2024**:
   - Total (B + C) = 27,720 + 3,960 = 31,680 units

3. **Calculate the Sales Price (P)**:
   - P = E / (B + C) = 1,980,000,000 yen / 31,680 units = 62,485.57 yen (approximately)

4. **Calculate the Post-recall Sales Volume (N)**:
   - N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 * 0.75 = 23,760 units

5. **Calculate the Decrease in Revenue (Y)**:
   - Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 62,485.57 * 31,680 * 0.25 = 494,880,000 yen (approximately)

6. **Calculate the Total Loss Amount (L)**:
   - L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 494,880,000 = 589,120,000 yen

7. **Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall (E')**:
   - E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 589,120,000 = 1,390,880,000 yen

8. **Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D')**:
   - D' is the total projected revenue for this fiscal year minus the losses incurred.
   - D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 589,120,000 = 2,182,880,000 yen

### Fill in the Blanks in <r048>:

1. **NR**: 11,880
2. **P**: 62,485.57
3. **X**: 94,240,000
4. **N**: 23,760
5. **Y**: 494,880,000
6. **L**: 589,120,000
7. **E'**: 1,390,880,000
8. **D'**: 2,182,880,000 

Thus, the completed <r048> is filled as follows:

### <r048>
Let A be the production volume in 2023, B the production plan volume for 2024, C the inventory volume as of April 2024, D the planned revenue for this fiscal year, and E the planned revenue for this fiscal year for the model subject to recall.
The number of units sold subject to recall, NR: **11,880** by subtracting the number of units remaining unsold as of April 2024 from the 2023 production volume A, **NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880**
The sales price of the model subject to recall, P: **62,485.57** by dividing the planned sales revenue E of the model by the total of the production plan volume B and the inventory volume C for 2024, **P = E / (B + C) = 1,980,000,000 / 31,680 = 62,485.57**
Therefore, the total recall cost X is, **X = 8,000 * NR = 8,000 * 11,880 = 94,240,000**
Since the planned sales volume is B + C, considering the reduction rate, the post-recall sales volume N is, **N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 * 0.75 = 23,760**
The decrease in revenue Y is, **Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 62,485.57 * 31,680 * 0.25 = 494,880,000**
The loss amount L is, **L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 494,880,000 = 589,120,000**
The revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, E', is, **E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 589,120,000 = 1,390,880,000**
The revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, D', is, **D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 589,120,000 = 2,182,880,000**.","<r057> will simulate the sales plan after the recall of the <r011> model based on the following sales plan. Please fill in the blanks in the <r048> according to the conditions.

### Given Data

1. **2023 Production (A)**: 15,840.00 <r054>
2. **2024 Production Plan (B)**: 27,720.00 <r054>
3. **Inventory as of April 2024 (C)**: 3,960.00 <r054>
4. **Projected Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D)**: 2,772.00 million yen
5. **<r059> Revenue (E)**: 1,980.00 million yen
6. **Cost per <r054> (X)**: 8,000 yen
7. **Reduction Rate**: 25%

### Calculations

1. **Calculate NR (number of <r054> remaining un<r045> as of April 2024)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840.00 - 3,960.00 = 11,880.00 <r054>
   \]

2. **Calculate total recall cost (X)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880.00 = 94,240,000 yen
   \]

3. **Calculate sales price (P)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{(B + C)} = \frac{1,980.00 \, \text{million yen}}{(27,720.00 + 3,960.00)} = \frac{1,980.00}{31,680.00} \approx 62.52 \, \text{million yen per <r054>}
   \]

4. **Calculate planned sales volume considering reduction rate (N)**:
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = (27,720.00 + 3,960.00) \times 0.75 = 31,680.00 \times 0.75 = 23,760.00 <r054>
   \]

5. **Calculate decrease in revenue (Y)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62.52 \times 31,680.00 \times 0.25 = 493,248.00 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

6. **Calculate loss amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 493,248.00 = 94,733,248.00 yen
   \]

7. **Calculate revised planned sales revenue for the model (E′)**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980.00 - 94,733.248 \approx 1,885.27 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

8. **Calculate revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D′)**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772.00 - 94.733248 \approx 2,677.27 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

### Summary of Results

- **Remaining un<r045> after recall (NR)**: 11,880.00 <r054>
- **Total recall cost (X)**: 94,240,000 yen
- **Sales price of <r059> (P)**: 62.52 million yen per <r054>
- **Post-recall sales volume (N)**: 23,760.00 <r054>

</Meta Information>","To analyze the situation regarding the ZX-1000 recall and its impact on sales and revenue, let's perform the calculations step by step as outlined in the simulation.

### Given Data
- **A (2023 units sold)**: 15,840 units
- **B (2024 planned sales)**: 27,720 units
- **C (Inventory as of April 2024)**: 3,960 units
- **D (Forecasted revenue for this fiscal year)**: 2,772 million yen
- **Recall cost per unit**: 8,000 yen
- **Estimated reduction rate**: 25%

### Steps of Calculation
1. **Calculate NR (Number of units subject to recall)**:
   \[
   \text{NR} = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Calculate the recall cost X**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times \text{NR} = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,240,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

3. **Calculate the price of the recalled units P**:
   First, calculate the total units sold for 2024 which is \( B + C \):
   \[
   B + C = 27,720 + 3,960 = 31,680 \text{ units}
   \]
   Then calculate the revenue for recalled units E, which can be derived by the total revenue planned for 2024:
   \[
   E = D = 2,772 \text{ million yen}
   \]
   Now calculate P:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{2,772,000,000}{31,680} \approx 87,500 \text{ yen}
   \]

4. **Calculate total decrease in revenue Y**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 87,500 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \approx 691,875,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total loss amount L**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 691,875,000 = 786,115,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

6. **Calculate revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall E'**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 2,772,000,000 - 786,115,000 = 1,985,885,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Calculate revised planned revenue D' for this fiscal year**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 786,115,000 = 1,985,885,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

### Summary of Results
- **Units subject to recall (NR)**: 11,880 units
- **Total recall cost (X)**: 94,240,000 yen
- **Price of recalled units (P)**: Approximately 87,500 yen
- **Total decrease in revenue (Y)**: Approximately 691,875,000 yen
- **Total loss amount (L)**: 786,115,000 yen
- **Revised planned sales revenue for ZX-1000 (E')**: 1,985,885,000 yen
- **Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**: 1,985,885,000 yen
