### Calculations

**1. Number of units sold subject to recall, \( NR \):**

- **Given:**
  - Production volume in 2023, \( A = 15,840 \)
  - Inventory volume as of April 2024, \( C = 3,960 \)

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880
  \]

**2. Sales price of the model subject to recall, \( P \):**

- **Given:**
  - Planned sales revenue for \(\text{<r011>}\) model, \( E = 1,980.00 \) million yen
  - Production plan volume for 2024, \( B = 27,720 \)
  - Inventory volume as of April 2024, \( C = 3,960 \)

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit or 62,500 yen per unit}
  \]

**3. Total recall cost, \( X \):**

- **Recall cost per unit is 8,000 yen.**

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen or } 95.04 \text{ million yen}
  \]

**4. Post-recall sales volume, \( N \):**

- **Total planned sales volume:** \( B + C = 31,680 \)

- **Reduction rate:** 25%

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760
  \]

**5. Decrease in revenue, \( Y \):**

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495 \text{ million yen}
  \]

**6. Loss amount, \( L \):**

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \text{ million yen}
  \]

**7. Revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, \( E' \):**

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \text{ million yen}
  \]

**8. Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, \( D' \):**

- **Given:**
  - Planned sales revenue for this fiscal year, \( D = 2,772.00 \) million yen

- **Calculation:**
  \[
  D' = D - L = 2,772.00 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \text{ million yen}
  \]

### Final answers:

- **Number of units sold subject to recall, \( NR \):** 11,880 units
- **Sales price of the model subject to recall, \( P \):** 62,500 yen per unit
- **Total recall cost, \( X \):** 95.04 million yen
- **Post-recall sales volume, \( N \):** 23,760 units
- **Decrease in revenue, \( Y \):** 495 million yen
- **Loss amount, \( L \):** 590.04 million yen
- **Revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, \( E' \):** 1,389.96 million yen
- **Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, \( D' \):** 2,181.96 million yen

</Meta Information>","Let's simulate the sales plan adjustment with the recall of the scooter model. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we calculate the changes to the sales plan based on the provided conditions:

### Given Data
- **Scooter Model:** \<r059\>
- **2023 Production Volume (A):** 15,840 units
- **2024 Production Plan Volume (B):** 27,720 units
- **Inventory as of April 2024 (C):** 3,960 units
- **Projected Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D):** 2,772 million yen
  - **Projected Revenue from \<r059\> Model (E):** 1,980 million yen

### Conditions
- **Recall cost per unit:** 8,000 yen
- **Reduction rate:** 25%

### Calculations

#### 1. Calculate the number of units subject to recall (NR):
\[ NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \]

#### 2. Calculate the sales price of the model (P):
\[ P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980\, \text{million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \, \text{million yen/unit} \]
\[ P \approx 62,500 \, \text{yen/unit} \]

#### 3. Calculate the total recall cost (X):
\[ X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \, \text{yen} \]
\[ X \approx 95.04 \, \text{million yen} \]

#### 4. Calculate the post-recall sales volume (N):
\[ N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \, \text{units} \]

#### 5. Calculate the decrease in revenue (Y):
\[ Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,500 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \]
\[ Y = 62,500 \times 7,920 = 495,000,000 \, \text{yen} \]
\[ Y \approx 495 \, \text{million yen} \]

#### 6. Calculate the loss amount (L):
\[ L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \, \text{million yen} \]

#### 7. Calculate the revised planned sales revenue for the model (E'):
\[ E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \, \text{million yen} \]

#### 8. Calculate the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D'):
\[ D' = D - L = 2,772 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \, \text{million yen} \]

### Summary of Adjusted Plan
- **Revised Revenue for Model:** 1,389.96 million yen
- **Revised Total Revenue for Fiscal Year:** 2,181.96 million yen

   - ZX-1000 Revenue (E): 1,980.00 million yen

3. **Recall Details:**
   - Recall Cost per Unit: 8,000 yen
   - Reduction Rate Post-Recall: 25%

### Calculations

1. **Number of Units Subject to Recall (NR):**
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Average Sales Price of Recalled Units (P):**
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980.00 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980.00}{31,680}
   \]
   \[
   P \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit}
   \]

3. **Total Recall Cost (X):**
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} = 95.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

4. **Post-Recall Sales Volume (N):**
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Decrease in Revenue Due to Recall (Y):**
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \approx 495 \text{ million yen}
   \]

6. **Total Loss Due to the Recall (L):**
   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 \approx 590.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

7. **Revised Planned Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall (E'):**
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980.00 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

8. **Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D'):**
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772.00 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

### Conclusion
Following the recall of the ZX-1000, the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year will be approximately 2,181.96 million yen.","<r057> will <r047> the <r044> <r031> after the recall of the ZX-1000 <r027> based on the following <r044> <r031>.

The recall cost per unit is <r046> at 8,000 yen, which includes all costs <r051> as <r030>, repairs, <r053>, and <r029> <r020>.
The <r034> <r044> <r056> N is estimated with a <r040> <r038> of 25%.

#Simulation
Let A be the <r036> <r056> in 2023, B the <r036> <r031> <r056> for 2024, C the inventory <r056> as of April 2024, D the <r031>ned revenue for this fiscal year, and E the <r031>ned revenue for this fiscal year for the <r027> subject to recall.
The <r028> of units <r045> subject to recall, NR: <r015> by <r050> the <r028> of units remaining un<r045> as of April 2024 from the 2023 <r036> <r056> A, <r023>, NR = A - C =

Therefore, the total recall cost X is, X = 8,000 * NR =
Since the planned sales volume is B + C, considering the reduction rate, the post-recall sales volume N is, N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) =
The decrease in revenue Y is, Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 =
The loss amount L is, L = X + Y =
The revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, E', is, E' = E - L =

</Meta Information>","The provided text appears to be a complex technical document involving a recall scenario for a particular scooter model. It includes financial calculations, inventory evaluations, and revenue projections related to the recall process. Here's a breakdown of what each part signifies:

1. **Scooter Model Information:**
   - The scooter model in question is denoted as ""<r059>"".
   - Key financial data for this model is provided, including the price for the 2023 and 2024 product lines and the inventory count as of April 2024.

2. **Revenue Figures:**
   - The total revenue for the fiscal year is 2,772 million yen, with domestic sales of the scooter model contributing 1,980 million yen.

3. **Cost Analysis of Recall:**
   - The cost of recall per scooter is estimated to be 8,000 yen.
   - A 25% reduction in the planned sales volume due to recall is anticipated.
   - Calculations involve determining non-sold scooters, planned revenue, recall costs, and impact on revenue.

4. **Formulas and Calculations:**
   - Recall Cost (X): Calculated based on unsold scooters (NR).
   - Post-recall Sales Volume (N): Adjusted for a 25% reduction.
   - Decrease in Revenue (Y): Based on the reduced sales volume.
   - Loss Amount (L): Combined total of recall costs and decrease in revenue.
   - Revised Planned Revenue: Adjusted for loss amounts to determine new targets post-recall.

5. **Meta Information:**
   - The document provides a glossary explaining the code system used (e.g., technical terms, product names, actions).

This is essentially an analytical approach to understanding the financial impact of a product recall, emphasizing changes in sales volumes, revenue forecasting, and adjusting financial plans accordingly.","<r057> will <r047> the <r044> <r031> after the recall of the <r059> <r027> based on the <r022> <r044> <r031>. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the <r016>.
