Let's define the variables as per the conditions and information given:

1. **Given Values**:
   - Production volume in 2023 (A): 15,840 units
   - Production plan volume for 2024 (B): 27,720 units
   - Inventory volume as of April 2024 (C): 3,960 units
   - Projected revenue for this fiscal year (D): 2,772 million yen
   - Revenue from the <r011> model (E): 1,980 million yen

2. **Calculate the number of units sold subject to recall (NR)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

3. **Calculate the sales price of the model subject to recall (P)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980,000,000}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980,000,000}{31,680} \approx 62,514 \text{ yen} \text{ (rounded to the nearest integer)}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total recall cost (X)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,240,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

5. **Calculate the post-recall sales volume (N)**:
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = (27,720 + 3,960) \times 0.75 = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

6. **Calculate the decrease in revenue (Y)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,514 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \approx 495,600,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Calculate the loss amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 495,600,000 = 589,840,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

8. **Calculate the revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E')**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 589,840,000 = 1,390,160,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

9. **Calculate the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 589,840,000 = 2,182,160,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

Now we can fill in the <r048> as follows:

### Completed <r048>
Let A be the production volume in 2023, B the production plan volume for 2024, C the inventory volume as of April 2024, D the planned revenue for this fiscal year, and E the planned revenue for this fiscal year for the model subject to recall. The number of units sold subject to recall, NR: **11,880** by subtracting the number of units remaining unsold as of April 2024 from the 2023 production volume A, **NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880**. The sales price of the model subject to recall, P: **62,514** by dividing the planned sales revenue E of the model by the total of the production plan volume B and the inventory volume C for 2024, **P = E / (B + C) = 1,980,000,000 / (27,720 + 3,960) = 62,514**. Therefore, the total recall cost X is, **X = 8,000 * NR = 8,000 * 11,880 = 94,240,000**. Since the planned sales volume is B + C, considering the reduction rate, the post-recall sales volume N is, **N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = (31,680) * (0.75) = 23,760**. The decrease in revenue Y is, **Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 62,514 * 31,680 * 0.25 = 495,600,000**. The loss amount L is, **L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 495,600,000 = 589,840,000**. The revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, E', is, **E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 589,840,000 = 1,390,160,000**. The revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, D', is, **D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 589,840,000 = 2,182,160,000**.","<r057> will simulate the sales plan after the recall of the <r011> model based on the following sales plan.

- **<r059> Revenue (E):** 1,980.00 million yen
- **Cost per <r054>:** 8,000 yen
- **Reduction Rate:** 25%

**Calculations:**

1. **Calculate NR:**  
   NR = A - C  
   NR = 15,840 – 3,960 = 11,880 <r054>

2. **Calculate Total Recall Cost (X):**  
   X = 8,000 * NR  
   X = 8,000 * 11,880 = 94,960,000 yen

3. **Calculate the sales price of the model (P):**  
   P = E / (B + C)  
   P = 1,980,000,000 yen / (27,720 + 3,960)  
   P = 1,980,000,000 yen / 31,680 = 62,500 yen

4. **Calculate Planned Sales Volume (B + C):**  
   Total planned sales volume = B + C = 27,720 + 3,960 = 31,680 <r054>

5. **Calculate Post-Recall Sales Volume (N):**  
   N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25)  
   N = 31,680 * 0.75 = 23,760 <r054>

6. **Calculate Decrease in Revenue (Y):**  
   Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25  
   Y = 62,500 * 31,680 * 0.25 = 493,125,000 yen

7. **Calculate Loss Amount (L):**  
   L = X + Y  
   L = 94,960,000 + 493,125,000 = 588,085,000 yen

8. **Calculate Revised Planned Sales Revenue (E'):**  
   E' = E - L  
   E' = 1,980,000,000 - 588,085,000 = 1,391,915,000 yen

</Meta Information>","To address the situation following the recall of the ZX-1000, we will calculate various financial impacts based on the provided data. Here’s the structured outline of the steps we will take:

1. **Calculate the number of units subject to recall (NR)**:
   - \( A \) (2023 sales volume) = 15,840 units
   - \( C \) (inventory as of April 2024) = 3,960 units
   - To find NR: 
     \[
     NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculate the recall cost (X)**:
   - Recall cost per unit = 8,000 yen
   - Total recall cost \( X = 8,000 \times NR \):
     \[
     X = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,960,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

3. **Calculate the price of the recalled units (P)**:
   - \( B \) (planned sales volume for 2024) = 27,720 units
   - Total for 2024 = B + C = 27,720 + 3,960 = 31,680 units
   - We need to calculate \( E \) (expected revenue for the fiscal year):
     - \( E \) from ZX-1000 = 1,980 million yen 
   - Therefore, to find \( P \):
     \[
     P = \frac{E}{(B + C)} = \frac{1,980,000,000}{31,680} \approx 62,500 \text{ yen/unit}
     \]

4. **Calculate the decrease in revenue (Y)**:
   - The decrease in revenue due to the reduction rate of 25%:
   - \( Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 \):
     \[
     Y = 62,500 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 494,250,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total loss amount (L)**:
   - \( L = X + Y \):
     \[
     L = 94,960,000 + 494,250,000 = 589,210,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

6. **Calculate the revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E')**:
   - \( E' = E - L \):
     \[
     E' = 1,980,000,000 - 589,210,000 = 1,390,790,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

7. **Calculate the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**:
   - \( D' = D - L \):
   - Given that the planned revenue for this fiscal year \( D \) was \( 2,772 \text{ million yen} \):
     \[
     D' = 2,772,000,000 - 589,210,000 = 2,182,790,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

In conclusion:
- The total number of units subject to recall (NR) is **11,880 units**.
- The total recall cost (X) amounts to **94,960,000 yen**.
- The price of the recalled units (P) is approximately **62,500 yen/unit**.
- The decrease in revenue (Y) is **494,250,000 yen**.
- The total loss amount (L) totals **589,210,000 yen**.
- The revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E') will be **1,390,790,000 yen**.
- The revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D') stands at **2,182,790,000 yen**.
