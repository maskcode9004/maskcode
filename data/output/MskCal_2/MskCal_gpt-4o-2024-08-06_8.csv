1. **Number of units sold subject to recall (NR):**
   - A = 15,840 (2023 Production Volume)
   - C = 3,960 (Inventory Volume as of April 2024)
   - NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 units

2. **Sales price of the model subject to recall (P):**
   - E = 1,980 million yen (Planned sales revenue for the model)
   - B = 27,720 (2024 Production Plan Volume)
   - P = E / (B + C) = 1,980 / (27,720 + 3,960) = 1,980 / 31,680 = 0.0625 million yen per unit

3. **Total recall cost (X):**
   - Recall cost per unit = 8,000 yen
   - X = 8,000 * NR = 8,000 * 11,880 = 95,040,000 yen or 95.04 million yen

4. **Post-recall sales volume (N):**
   - Reduction rate = 25%
   - Planned sales volume = B + C = 31,680
   - N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 * 0.75 = 23,760 units

5. **Decrease in revenue (Y):**
   - Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 0.0625 * 31,680 * 0.25 = 495 million yen

6. **Loss amount (L):**
   - L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 million yen

7. **Revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E'):**
   - E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 million yen

</Meta Information>","To simulate the sales plan adjustments based on the recall of the scooter model (referred to as <r059>), let's break down the calculations according to the template provided.

### Values from the Plan:
- **A (2023 Production Volume):** 15,840 units
- **B (2024 Production Plan Volume):** 27,720 units
- **C (Inventory as of April 2024):** 3,960 units
- **D (Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year):** 2,772 million yen
- **E (Planned Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall):** 1,980 million yen

### Recall-Related Calculations:
1. **Number of Units Subject to Recall, NR:**
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Sales Price of the Model Subject to Recall, P:**
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit} 
   \]

3. **Total Recall Cost, X:**
   \[
   X = 8,000 \text{ yen} \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} \approx 95.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

4. **Post-Recall Sales Volume, N:**
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Decrease in Revenue, Y:**
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495 \text{ million yen}
   \]

6. **Loss Amount, L:**
   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

7. **Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model, E':**
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

8. **Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year, D':**
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

### Conclusion:
By substituting the recall-related figures into the initial sales plan, we account for the direct impact of the recall. The revised planned sales revenue for the scooter model subject to recall (E') is now 1,389.96 million yen, and the overall revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D') is 2,181.96 million yen. These calculations reflect the costs associated with the recall and potential revenue reductions.","We will simulate the sales plan after the <r039> of the <r059> model <r013> on the following sales plan. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the conditions.

</Meta Information>","To calculate the revised sales and revenue figures considering the recall of the ZX-1000 model, we'll follow the simulation steps outlined in the information provided.

1. **Determine NR** (number of units subject to recall):
   - Given the inventory at the end of April 2024 (C) is 3,960 units, and the total production in 2023 (A) is the same as the sales plan for 2023, which is 15,840 units.
   - Calculate: \( \text{NR} = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}\).

2. **Calculate the recall price per unit, P**: 
   - The planned revenue for this fiscal year (D) is 2,772 million yen, and the specific revenue for ZX-1000 is 1,980 million yen (E).
   - Production plan for 2024 is 27,720 units (B).
   - Calculate: \( P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{31,680} \).

3. **Calculate recall cost, X**:
   - Recall cost per unit is 8,000 yen.
   - Total recall cost: \( X = 8,000 \text{ yen} \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen}\).

4. **Calculate post-recall sales volume, N**:
   - Planned sales volume \( (B + C) = 31,680 \).
   - Considering the reduction rate of 25%, calculate: \( N = 31,680 \times (1 - 0.25) = 23,760 \text{ units} \).

5. **Calculate decrease in revenue, Y**:
   - \( Y = P \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \).

6. **Calculate loss amount, L**:
   - \( L = X + Y \).

7. **Calculate revised planned sales revenue for the recalled model, E'**:
   - \( E' = E - L \).

8. **Calculate revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, D'**:

</Meta Information>","This document appears to be an analysis concerning the financial impact of a recall on a specific scooter model, denoted as \(<r059>\). The discussion involves recalculating various financial metrics after accounting for the costs and loss of revenue stemming from the recall.

The analysis involves:

1. **Recall Costs Calculation:**
   - The recall expense per unit is set at 8,000 yen. The volume of scooters initially planned to be sold is adjusted using a reduction rate of 25%.

2. **Key Variables:**
   - **A** is the sales volume in 2023.
   - **B** is the projected sales volume for 2024.
   - **C** is the inventory count as of April 2024.
   - **D** represents the planned total revenue for the fiscal year.
   - **E** estimates the revenue from the scooter model that needs the recall.

3. **Calculations:**
   - **NR (Number Required):** \( NR = A - C \). This represents the number of units sold that might need recalling.
   - **P (Price per unit of scooter under recall):** \( P = \frac{E}{B + C} \). This gives the average price per unit.
   - **Total Recall Cost (X):** \( X = 8,000 \times NR \).
   - **Post-recall Sales Volume (N):** \( N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) \).
   - **Decrease in Revenue (Y):** \( Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 \).
   - **Total Loss (L):** \( L = X + Y \).
   - **Revised Revenue for Recalled Model (E'):** \( E' = E - L \).
   - **Revised Total Revenue for Fiscal Year (D'):** \( D' = D - L \).

By following the steps outlined, the company aims to determine the adjusted financial outlook, post-recall, ensuring they have an accurate forecast of their fiscal standing and can strategize accordingly.","<r057> will <r047> the <r044> <r031> after the recall of the <r059> <r027> based on the <r022> <r044> <r031>. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the <r016>.
