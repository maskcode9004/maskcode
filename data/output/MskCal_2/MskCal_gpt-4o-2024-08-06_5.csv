Here's how we can fill in the blanks:

1. **Calculate the number of units sold subject to recall (NR):**
   - The number of units sold subject to recall, NR, is calculated by subtracting the inventory volume C from the 2023 production volume A.
   - NR = A - C = 15,840 units - 3,960 units = 11,880 units

2. **Calculate the sales price of the model subject to recall (P):**
   - The sales price P is calculated by dividing the planned sales revenue E of the model by the total of the production plan volume for 2024 (B) and the inventory volume C.
   - B + C = 27,720 units + 3,960 units = 31,680 units
   - P = E / (B + C) = 1,980 million yen / 31,680 units = 0.0625 million yen per unit

3. **Calculate the total recall cost (X):**
   - The total recall cost X is calculated by multiplying the recall cost per unit by the number of units sold subject to recall.
   - X = 8,000 yen * 11,880 units = 95,040,000 yen

4. **Calculate the post-recall sales volume (N):**
   - The post-recall sales volume N is calculated by applying the reduction rate to the planned sales volume.
   - N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 units * 0.75 = 23,760 units

5. **Calculate the decrease in revenue (Y):**
   - The decrease in revenue Y is calculated by multiplying the sales price P by the reduction in sales volume due to the recall.
   - Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 0.0625 million yen per unit * 31,680 units * 0.25 = 495 million yen

6. **Calculate the loss amount (L):**
   - The loss amount L is the sum of the total recall cost and the decrease in revenue.
   - L = X + Y = 95,040,000 yen + 495,000,000 yen = 590,040,000 yen or 590.04 million yen

7. **Calculate the revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E'):**
   - E' = E - L = 1,980 million yen - 590.04 million yen = 1,389.96 million yen

8. **Calculate the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D'):**
   - D' = D - L = 2,772 million yen - 590.04 million yen = 2,181.96 million yen

Based on these calculations, the simulated sales plan after the recall reflects the adjustments needed due to the recall impact.","<r057> will simulate the sales plan after the recall of the <r011> model based on the following sales plan.

</Meta Information>","To simulate the sales plan after the recall of the scooter model, following the given conditions and references, let's calculate the required values:

1. **Initial Definitions Based on References:**
   - **A**: Production volume in 2023 = 15,840 units.
   - **B**: Production plan for 2024 = 27,720 units.
   - **C**: Inventory level as of April 2024 = 3,960 units.
   - **D**: Planned revenue for this fiscal year = 2,772 million yen.
   - **E**: Planned revenue for the recalled model = 1,980 million yen.

2. **Calculations:**
   - **Number of units under recall (NR)**:
     \[
     NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
     \]

   - **Sales price per unit of the recalled model (P)**:
     \[
     P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit}
     \]

   - **Total recall cost (X)**:
     \[
     X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

   - **Post-recall sales volume (N)**:
     \[
     N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
     \]

   - **Decrease in revenue (Y)**:
     \[
     Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

   - **Total loss (L)**:
     \[
     L = X + Y = 95,040,000 + 495,000 = 95,535,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

3. **Revised Revenue Calculations:**
   - **Revised planned revenue for the recalled model (E')**:
     \[
     E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 95,535,000 = 1,884,465,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

   - **Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**:
     \[
     D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 95,535,000 = 2,676,465,000 \text{ yen}
     \]

</Meta Information>","To perform the calculations outlined in your simulation, let's use the provided data and meta information:

1. **Calculate NR (the number of units no longer available due to the recall):**
   - A (Sales volume in 2023) = 15,840 units
   - C (Inventory volume as of April 2024) = 3,960 units
   - NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 units

2. **Determine P (the average price of the product subject to recall):**
   - E (Planned revenue for this fiscal year for the product subject to recall) = 1,980.00 million yen
   - B (Sales volume planned for 2024) = 27,720 units
   - P = E / (B + C) = 1,980.00 million yen / (27,720 + 3,960) = 1,980.00 million yen / 31,680 units = 62,500 yen/unit

3. **Calculate X (total recall cost):**
   - Recall cost per unit = 8,000 yen
   - X = 8,000 yen * NR = 8,000 yen * 11,880 = 95,040,000 yen or 95.04 million yen

4. **Determine post-recall sales volume N:**
   - The reduction rate is 25%.
   - N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 * 0.75 = 23,760 units

5. **Calculate Y (the decrease in revenue):**
   - Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 62,500 yen/unit * 31,680 * 0.25 = 495,000,000 yen or 495 million yen

6. **Determine the loss amount L:**
   - L = X + Y = 95.04 million yen + 495 million yen = 590.04 million yen

7. **Calculate the revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, E':**
   - E' = E - L = 1,980.00 million yen - 590.04 million yen = 1,389.96 million yen

8. **Calculate the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, D':**
   - D (Planned revenue for this fiscal year) = 2,772.00 million yen
   - D' = D - L = 2,772.00 million yen - 590.04 million yen = 2,181.96 million yen

Revise to be complete (r033) complete or provide content (r021) in an empty space or location (r014) in agreement (r012) to a requirement or circumstance (r016).

In the financial section:
- For 2023, the inventory of goods (r002) within a specific geographical area is 15,840.00 units (r054).
- For 2024, the amount or quantity (r010) is 27,720.00 units (r054).
- As of the end of April 2024, there is a remaining inventory (r002) of 3,960.00 units (r054).

Looking at income and estimations:
- Estimated revenue for this fiscal year is 2,772.00 million yen.
- Estimate or forecast specific to domestic operations is 1,980.00 million yen.

For cost calculation:
- Price per single item (r054) is set at 8,000 yen.
- It includes all references as components, sections, moving goods, and outflows of money (r017).
- Post-recall the model (r034) is calculated with a loss rate (r040) of 25%.

Regarding a sales model:
- 2023 production is scenario A.
- 2024 production is scenario B.
- Inventory as of April 2024 is scenario C.
- Planned revenue for the fiscal year is scenario D.
- Planned revenue for the recall model is scenario E.
- Compute net recall units NR by subtracting current inventory from production of 2023: NR = A - C.
- Compute planned recall sales price P using planned revenue over production and inventory of 2024: P = E / (B + C).
- Compute total recall cost X: X = 8,000 * NR.
- Compute post-recall sales volume N: N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25).
- Determine revenue decrease Y: Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25.
- Loss amount L: L = X + Y.
- Revised planned sales revenue for the model: E' = E - L.
- Revised planned revenue for the year: D' = D - L.
