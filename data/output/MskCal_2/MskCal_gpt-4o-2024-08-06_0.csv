1. **Determine NR (Number of units sold subject to recall):**

   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840.00 - 3,960.00 = 11,880.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the sales price \( P \) of the model subject to recall:**

   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980.00 \, \text{million yen}}{27,720.00 + 3,960.00} = \frac{1,980.00}{31,680.00} \approx 0.0625 \, \text{million yen per unit}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total recall cost \( X \):**

   \[
   X = 8,000 \, \text{yen} \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880.00 = 95,040,000 \, \text{yen} = 95.04 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

4. **Calculate the post-recall sales volume \( N \):**

   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680.00 \times 0.75 = 23,760.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the decrease in revenue \( Y \):**

   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680.00 \times 0.25 = 495.00 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

6. **Calculate the loss amount \( L \):**

   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495.00 = 590.04 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

7. **Determine the revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, \( E' \):**

   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980.00 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \, \text{million yen}
   \]

8. **Determine the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, \( D' \):**

   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772.00 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \, \text{million yen}

</Meta Information>","Based on your provided sales plan and assumptions, here's the breakdown of the recalculated financials and outcomes after applying the recall (technical term: <r039>) for the scooter model (<r059>).

### Calculation Steps

1. **Initial Data:**
   - Production volume in 2023 (A): 15,840 units
   - Production plan for 2024 (B): 27,720 units
   - Inventory as of April 2024 (C): 3,960 units
   - Planned fiscal year revenue (D): 2,772 million yen
   - Planned model-specific revenue (E): 1,980 million yen

2. **Recall Calculations:**

    - **Number of units subject to recall (NR):**
      \[ \text{NR} = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units} \]

    - **Sales price of the recalled model (P):**
      \[ P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} \approx \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit} \]
      \[ P \approx 62,500 \text{ yen per unit} \]

    - **Total recall cost (X):**
      \[ X = 8,000 \times \text{NR} = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} \]
      \[ X = 95.04 \text{ million yen} \]

    - **Post-recall sales volume (N):**
      \[ N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units} \]

    - **Decrease in revenue (Y):**
      \[ Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 62,500 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \]
      \[ Y = 62,500 \times 7,920 = 495,000,000 \text{ yen} \]
      \[ Y = 495 \text{ million yen} \]

    - **Total loss amount (L):**
      \[ L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \text{ million yen} \]

3. **Revised Financial Projections:**

    - **Revised planned model-specific revenue (E'):**
      \[ E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \text{ million yen} \]

    - **Revised planned fiscal year revenue (D'):**
      \[ D' = D - L = 2,772 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \text{ million yen} \]

### Summary

After accounting for the recall costs and reduced sales volume following the recall, the revised planned revenue for the scooter model subject to recall is 1,389.96 million yen.

### Given Data:
- **2023 Production (A)**: 15,840 units
- **2024 Planned Sales (B)**: 27,720 units
- **Inventory as of April 2024 (C)**: 3,960 units
- **Planned Revenue for Fiscal Year (D)**: 2,772 million yen
- **Recall-related Revenue (E)**: 1,980 million yen

### Cost Parameters:
- **Recall Cost per Unit**: 8,000 yen
- **Reduction Rate**: 25%

### Calculations:

1. **Units Subject to Recall (NR):**
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880
   \]

2. **Price per Unit for Recalled Model (P):**
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit}
   \]

3. **Total Recall Cost (X):**
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

4. **Post-recall Sales Volume (N):**
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Decrease in Revenue (Y):**
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495 \text{ million yen}
   \]

6. **Total Loss Amount (L):**
   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \text{ million yen}

</Meta Information>","Based on the text provided, it seems like a detailed financial analysis concerning a scooter model's recall. Here's a structured breakdown of the information and calculations:

### Given Data:

- **Scooter Model:** <r059>
- **Manufacturing Costs:**
  - 2023 Costs: 15,840.00 <r054>
  - 2024 Costs: 27,720.00 <r054>
- **Domestic Inventory (as of April 2024):** 3,960.00 <r054>
- **Revenue for Fiscal Year:**
  - Total Revenue: 2,772.00 million yen
  - Domestic Revenue: 1,980.00 million yen

### Recall Analysis:

- **Recall Cost per Item:** 8,000 yen
- **Post-Recall Sales Volume Reduction:** 25%
- **Sales Volume:**
  - A (2023 Sales Volume)
  - B (2024 Planned Sales Volume)
  - C (April 2024 Inventory)

### Calculations:

1. **Number of Units Need to Recall (NR):**
   - NR = A - C

2. **Projected Sales Price (P):**
   - P = E / (B + C)

3. **Total Recall Cost (X):**
   - X = 8,000 * NR

4. **Post-Recall Sales Volume (N):**
   - N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25)

5. **Decrease in Revenue (Y):**
   - Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25

6. **Total Loss from Recall (L):**
   - L = X + Y

7. **Revised Planned Sales Revenue for Recalled Model (E'):**
   - E' = E - L

8. **Revised Planned Total Revenue for Fiscal Year (D'):**
   - D' = D - L

### Conclusion

By analyzing these computations, the organization can determine the financial impact of the recall on their total revenues and the specific scooter model's revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. This information can aid in strategic planning and adjustment of sales projections.","<r057> will <r047> the <r044> <r031> after the recall of the <r059> <r027> based on the <r022> <r044> <r031>. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the <r016>.
