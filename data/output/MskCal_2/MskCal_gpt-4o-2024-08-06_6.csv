### Given Data:
- **Production Volume in 2023 (A)**: 15,840 units
- **Production Plan Volume for 2024 (B)**: 27,720 units
- **Inventory Volume as of April 2024 (C)**: 3,960 units
- **Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D)**: 2,772 million yen
- **Planned Revenue for Model Subject to Recall (E)**: 1,980 million yen
- **Recall Cost per Unit**: 8,000 yen
- **Reduction Rate After Recall**: 25%

### Calculations:
1. **Number of Units Sold Subject to Recall (NR)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Sales Price of the Model Subject to Recall (P)**:
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen/unit}
   \]

3. **Total Recall Cost (X)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} = 95.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

4. **Post-recall Sales Volume (N)**:
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Decrease in Revenue (Y)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 494 \text{ million yen}
   \]

6. **Loss Amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 494 = 589.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

7. **Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall (E')**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980 - 589.04 = 1,390.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

8. **Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D')**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772 - 589.04 = 2,182.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

### Results:
- Number of Units Sold Subject to Recall (NR): 11,880 units
- Sales Price of the Model Subject to Recall (P): 0.0625 million yen/unit
- Total Recall Cost (X): 95.04 million yen
- Post-recall Sales Volume (N): 23,760 units
- Decrease in Revenue (Y): 494 million yen
- Loss Amount (L): 589.04 million yen
- Revised Planned Sales Revenue for Model Subject to Recall (E'): 1,390.96 million yen
- Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D'): 2,182.96 million yen","<r057> will simulate the sales plan after the recall of the <r011> model based on the following sales plan. Please fill in the blanks in the <r048> according to the conditions.

</Meta Information>","To simulate the sales plan considering the recall of the scooter model, we'll use the provided conditions and reference data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown based on the information and calculations specified:

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Definitions and Initial Data:**
   - **A (2023 Production Volume):** 15,840 units
   - **B (2024 Production Plan Volume):** 27,720 units
   - **C (Inventory Volume as of April 2024):** 3,960 units
   - **D (Projected Revenue for This Fiscal Year):** 2,772 million yen
   - **E (Projected Revenue for Model Subject to Recall):** 1,980 million yen
   - **Recall Cost per Unit:** 8,000 yen
   - **Reduction Rate:** 25%

2. **Calculating the Number of Units Subject to Recall (NR):**
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Sales Price per Unit (P) for Model Subject to Recall:**
   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980 \text{ million yen}}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen/unit}
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Recall Cost (X):**
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} = 95.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

5. **Calculating Post-recall Sales Volume (N):**
   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

6. **Calculating the Decrease in Revenue (Y):**
   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495 \text{ million yen}
   \]

7. **Calculating the Loss Amount (L):**
   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

8. **Calculating Revised Planned Sales Revenue for Model Subject to Recall (E'):**
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

9. **Calculating Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D'):**
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

After considering the recall and its impact, the revised planned sales revenue for the scooter model is 1,389.96 million yen, and the revised planned revenue for this fiscal year is 2,181.96 million yen.","We will simulate the sales plan after the <r039> of the <r059> model <r013> on the following sales plan. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the conditions.

</Meta Information>","To determine the revised figures following the recall of the ZX-1000 model based on the provided data, we can follow the simulation steps:

1. **Calculate the Number of Units Subject to Recall (NR):**
   Use the formula:  
   NR = A - C = 15,840.00 units (2023 sales) - 3,960.00 units (inventory end of April 2024)  
   NR = 11,880 units

2. **Determine the Total Recall Cost (X):**  
   X = 8,000 yen/unit * 11,880 units  
   X = 95,040,000 yen

3. **Post-recall Sales Volume (N):**  
   Calculate the planned sales volume (B + C) for 2024:  
   B + C = 27,720.00 units (planned 2024 sales) + 3,960.00 units (inventory)  
   B + C = 31,680 units

   Apply the reduction rate of 25% due to the recall:  
   N = 31,680 units * (1 - 0.25) = 23,760 units

4. **Calculate the Planned Sales Revenue for the Recalled Model (E):**  
   Given: E = 1,980.00 million yen

   Determine the sales price per unit (P) for the recalled model:  
   P = E / (B + C)  
   P = 1,980.00 million yen / 31,680 units  
   P = 0.0625 million yen per unit (or 62,500 yen per unit)

5. **Calculate the Decrease in Revenue (Y):**  
   Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25  
   Y = 62,500 yen/unit * 31,680 units * 0.25  
   Y = 492.5 million yen

6. **Determine the Loss Amount (L):**  
   L = X + Y  
   L = 95.04 million yen (recall cost) + 492.5 million yen (decreased revenue)  
   L = 587.54 million yen

7. **Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall (E'):**  
   E' = E - L  
   E' = 1,980.00 million yen - 587.54 million yen  
   E' = 1,392.46 million yen

8. **Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D'):**  
   Given: D = 2,772.00 million yen

   D' = D - L  
   D' = 2,772.00 million yen - 587.54 million yen  
   D' = 2,184.46 million yen

These calculations provide the revised sales projections and financial implications after considering the recall and the adjustments in sales volume and revenue.","<r057> will <r047> the <r044> <r031> after the recall of the ZX-1000 <r027> based on the following <r044> <r031>.

</Meta Information>","This is a highly technical document that appears to focus on the financial and logistical impacts of a product recall for a specific scooter model. The recall process involves calculating various metrics related to sales, inventory, and costs. The document outlines the following key concepts:

1. **Recall Impact Calculations**: The document provides formulas for calculating recall-related metrics, such as the total recall cost (X) based on the volume of units sold that are subject to recall, and the sales volume reduction post-recall (N).

2. **Revenue Adjustments**: It addresses adjustments to planned sales revenue for the current fiscal year due to the recall. It calculates the decrease in revenue (Y) due to the recall and the overall loss amount (L), which is then used to update the revised planned sales revenue (E') and the revised planned revenue for the fiscal year (D').

3. **Data Sources and References**: The document references various data points, such as the 2023 and 2024 production volumes, the domestic inventory at the end of April 2024, and fiscal year revenue.

4. **Technical Terminology**: Numerous coded references and technical terms are used throughout the document to describe complex processes, calculations, and organizational roles involved in managing the recall.

5. **Contextual Relationships**: The document suggests relationships between different data points, calculations, and outcomes, emphasizing the interconnected nature of recall management and financial planning.
