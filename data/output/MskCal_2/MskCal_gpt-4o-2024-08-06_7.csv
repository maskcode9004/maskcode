1. **Calculate NR (The Number of Units Sold Subject to Recall):**
   - \( NR = A - C \)
   - \( NR = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \) units

2. **Calculate P (The Sales Price of the Model Subject to Recall):**
   - \( P = \frac{E}{B + C} \)
   - \( P = \frac{1,980.00}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980.00}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \) million yen per unit (or 62,500 yen per unit)

3. **Calculate the Total Recall Cost X:**
   - \( X = 8,000 \times NR \)
   - \( X = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \) yen or 95.04 million yen

4. **Calculate the Post-Recall Sales Volume N:**
   - \( N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) \)
   - \( N = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \) units

5. **Calculate the Decrease in Revenue Y:**
   - \( Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 \)
   - \( Y = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 496.5 \) million yen

6. **Calculate the Loss Amount L:**
   - \( L = X + Y \)
   - \( L = 95.04 + 496.5 = 591.54 \) million yen

7. **Calculate the Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the Model Subject to Recall E':**
   - \( E' = E - L \)
   - \( E' = 1,980.00 - 591.54 = 1,388.46 \) million yen

8. **Calculate the Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year D':**
   - \( D' = D - L \)
   - \( D' = 2,772.00 - 591.54 = 2,180.46 \) million yen

Here are the filled-in blanks for the <r048>:

- **NR = 11,880**
- **P ≈ 0.0625 million yen per unit (or 62,500 yen per unit)**
- **X = 95.04 million yen**
- **N = 23,760 units**
- **Y = 496.5 million yen**
- **L = 591.54 million yen**

</Meta Information>","To simulate the sales plan after the recall of the scooter model referenced in your sales plan, let's use the conditions and details provided. Here's a breakdown of the calculations:

### Definitions and Calculations

**Variables:**
- **A:** Production volume in 2023 = 15,840 units
- **B:** Production plan volume for 2024 = 27,720 units
- **C:** Inventory volume as of April 2024 = 3,960 units
- **D:** Planned revenue for this fiscal year = 2,772 million yen
- **E:** Planned revenue for the model subject to recall for the fiscal year = 1,980 million yen
- **Recall cost per unit:** 8,000 yen
- **Reduction rate for sales volume after recall:** 25%

#### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Number of units subject to recall (NR):**

   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Sales price of the model subject to recall (P):**

   \[
   P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit}
   \]

3. **Total recall cost (X):**

   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen (or 95.04 million yen)}
   \]

4. **Post-recall sales volume (N):**

   \[
   N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Decrease in revenue (Y):**

   \[
   Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495 \text{ million yen}
   \]

6. **Loss amount (L):**

   \[
   L = X + Y = 95.04 + 495 = 590.04 \text{ million yen}
   \]

7. **Revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E'):**

   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980 - 590.04 = 1,389.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

8. **Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D'):**

   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772 - 590.04 = 2,181.96 \text{ million yen}
   \]

### Summary

After recalculating based on the conditions of the recall, the revised planned sales revenue for the scooter model subject to recall is 1,389.96 million yen, while the overall revised planned revenue for the fiscal year is 2,181.96 million yen.","We will simulate the sales plan after the <r039> of the <r059> model <r013> on the following sales plan. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the conditions.

</Meta Information>","To determine the revised sales plan and losses associated with the recall of the ZX-1000 motorcycle model, we'll follow the simulation steps using the provided information.

**1. Calculate the Number of Units Subject to Recall (NR):**
- Total 2023 Sales Volume (A): 15,840 units
- Inventory as of April 2024 (C): 3,960 units

\[ \text{NR} = \text{A} - \text{C} = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units} \]

**2. Calculate the Price of the Units Subject to Recall (P):**
- Planned Revenue for the Fiscal Year for ZX-1000 (E): 1,980 million yen
- Planned Sales Volume for 2024 (B): 27,720 units
- Inventory for 2024 (C): 3,960 units

\[ P = \frac{E}{B + C} = \frac{1,980}{27,720 + 3,960} = \frac{1,980}{31,680} \approx 0.0625 \text{ million yen per unit} \]

**3. Calculate the Total Recall Cost (X):**
- Recall Cost per Unit: 8,000 yen

\[ X = 8,000 \times \text{NR} = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} \]

**4. Calculate the Post-Recall Sales Volume (N):**
- Reduction Rate: 25%

\[ N = (B + C) \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units} \]

**5. Calculate the Decrease in Revenue (Y):**

\[ Y = P \times (B + C) \times 0.25 = 0.0625 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 = 495.00 \text{ million yen} \]

**6. Calculate the Loss Amount (L):**

\[ L = X + Y = 95,040,000 \text{ yen} + 495,000,000 \text{ yen} = 590,040,000 \text{ yen} \]

**7. Calculate the Revised Planned Sales Revenue for the ZX-1000 (E’):**

\[ E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 \text{ yen} - 590,040,000 \text{ yen} = 1,389,960,000 \text{ yen} \]

**8. Calculate the Revised Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D’):**
- Planned Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D): 2,772 million yen

\[ D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 \text{ yen} - 590,040,000 \text{ yen} = 2,181,960,000 \text{ yen} \]

</Meta Information>","The passage seems to describe a financial and logistical analysis related to a recall event for a specific scooter model. Let's decode this by using the provided meta information.

1. **Recall Event Context**:
   - A recall event (\<r039\>) is initiated for the scooter model (\<r059\>), affecting current and projected sales. The recall impacts the goals and revenue forecasts (\<r043\>) for both 2023 and 2024.

2. **Cost and Revenue Analysis**:
   - The initial cost per unit (\<r054\>) for managing the recall is estimated (\<r046\>) at 8,000 yen.
   - Sales reductions and costs associated with the recall are calculated, showing both a direct recall cost and the impact on overall revenue due to reduced sales volume (\<r056\>).

3. **Definitions and Values Used**:
   - The terms used in the calculations like ""post-recall sales volume"" and estimated revenue losses are detailed in the sections defining terms like NR (number recalled), P (proportion), and L (loss amount).

4. **Financial Projections**:
   - The document contains projections for expected sales (\<r005\>) and revenue (\<r007\>) for the fiscal years 2023 and 2024, along with how these figures would need adjustment post-recall.

5. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - Calculations involve finding:
     - NR = Initial stock minus April 2024 stock.
     - P = Estimated revenue divided by total stock for 2024.
     - Total recall cost X, decrease in revenue Y, and eventual loss L.
     - Revised revenues post-loss adjustments.

6. **Outcome**:
   - The outcome of the analysis guides adjustments in sales strategies and projections for the upcoming fiscal periods, taking into account the fiscal impact of the recall.

In essence, the passage presents a structured approach to handling the financial implications of a product recall event, using defined variables to compute expected losses and adjust future revenue plans accordingly.","<r057> will <r047> the <r044> <r031> after the <r039> of the <r059> <r027> <r013> on the <r022> <r044> <r031>. <r033> <r021> in the <r014> in the <r048> <r012> to the <r016>.
