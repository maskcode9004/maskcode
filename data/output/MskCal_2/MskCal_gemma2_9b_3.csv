### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Given Values:**
   - A (Production Volume in 2023) = 15,840 units
   - C (Inventory Volume as of April 2024) = 3,960 units
   - B (Production Plan Volume for 2024) = 27,720 units
   - Revenue figure for the model subject to recall (E) = 1,980 million yen

2. **Calculating NR (Number of units sold subject to recall):**
   - NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 units

3. **Calculating P (Sales price of the model subject to recall):**
   - Total planned sales for 2024 = B + C = 27,720 + 3,960 = 31,680 units
   - P = E / (B + C) = 1,980 million yen / 31,680 = 62.5 million yen per unit (rounded)

4. **Calculating Total Recall Cost X:**
   - X = 8,000 * NR = 8,000 * 11,880 = 94,960,000 yen

5. **Calculating N (Post-recall sales volume):**
   - N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 * 0.75 = 23,760 units 

6. **Calculating Decrease in Revenue Y:**
   - Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 62.5 * 31,680 * 0.25 = 493,125,000 yen

7. **Calculating Loss Amount L:**
   - L = X + Y = 94,960,000 + 493,125,000 = 588,085,000 yen

8. **Calculating Revised Planned Sales Revenue E':**
   - E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 588,085,000 = 1,391,915,000 yen

9. **Calculating Revised Planned Revenue D':**
   - original D = 2,772 million yen (Projected Revenue for This Fiscal Year)
   - D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 588,085,000 = 2,183,915,000 yen

### Final Values to Fill in <r048>:

```plaintext
Let A be the production volume in 2023, B the production plan volume for 2024, C the inventory volume as of April 2024, D the planned revenue for this fiscal year, and E the planned revenue for this fiscal year for the model subject to recall.
The number of units sold subject to recall, NR: 11,880 units by determining the number of units remaining unsold as of April 2024 from the 2023 production volume A, NR = A - C = 11,880.
The sales price of the model subject to recall, P: 62.5 million yen by dividing the planned sales revenue E of the model by the total of the production plan volume B and the inventory volume C for 2024, P = E / (B + C) = 62.5 million yen.
Therefore, the total recall cost X is, X = 8,000 * NR = 94,960,000 yen.
Since the planned sales volume is B + C, considering the reduction rate, the post-recall sales volume N is, N = (B + C) * (1 - 0.25) = 23,760 units.
The decrease in revenue Y is, Y = P * (B + C) * 0.25 = 493,125,000 yen.
The loss amount L is, L = X + Y = 588,085,000 yen.
The revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall, E', is, E' = E - L = 1,391,915,000 yen.
The revised planned revenue for this fiscal year, D', is, D' = D - L = 2,183,915,000 yen.

### Given Data:
- **Scooter Model**: <r059>
- **2023 Production (A)**: 15,840 units
- **2024 Production Plan (B)**: 27,720 units
- **Inventory as of April 2024 (C)**: 3,960 units
- **Projected Revenue for This Fiscal Year (D)**: 2,772.00 million yen
- **<r059> Revenue (E)**: 1,980.00 million yen

### Cost and Reduction Parameters:
- **Cost per unit (<r039>)**: 8,000 yen
- **Reduction rate**: 25%

### Calculations:
1. **Calculate the number of remaining unsold units (NR)**:
   \[
   NR = A - C = 15,840 - 3,960 = 11,880 \text{ units}
   \]

2. **Total recall cost (X)**:
   \[
   X = 8,000 \times NR = 8,000 \times 11,880 = 94,240,000 \text{ yen} 
   \]

3. **Total planned sales volume (T)**:
   \[
   T = B + C = 27,720 + 3,960 = 31,680 \text{ units}
   \]

4. **Post-recall sales volume (N)**:
   \[
   N = T \times (1 - 0.25) = 31,680 \times 0.75 = 23,760 \text{ units}
   \]

5. **Sales price (P)**:
   \[
   P = E / T = 1,980,000,000 / 31,680 \approx 62,495.37 \text{ yen per unit}
   \]

6. **Decrease in revenue (Y)**:
   \[
   Y = P \times (T \times 0.25) = 62,495.37 \times 31,680 \times 0.25 \approx 495,000,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

7. **Loss amount (L)**:
   \[
   L = X + Y = 94,240,000 + 495,000,000 \approx 589,240,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

8. **Revised planned sales revenue for the model subject to recall (E')**:
   \[
   E' = E - L = 1,980,000,000 - 589,240,000 \approx 1,390,760,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

9. **Revised planned revenue for this fiscal year (D')**:
   \[
   D' = D - L = 2,772,000,000 - 589,240,000 \approx 2,182,760,000 \text{ yen}
   \]

### Summary of Results:
- **Remaining unsold units (NR)**: 11,880 units
- **Total recall cost (X)**: 94,240,000 yen
- **Planned sales volume (T)**: 31,680 units
- **Post-recall sales volume (N)**: 23,760 units
- **Sales price (P)**: Approximately 62,495.37 yen per unit
- **Decrease in revenue (Y)**: Approximately 495,000,000 yen
- **Total loss amount (L)**: Approximately 589,240,000 yen
- **Revised planned sales revenue (E')**: Approximately 1,390,760,000 yen
- **Revised planned revenue (D')**: Approximately 2,182,760,000 yen

</Meta Information>","Let's break down the simulation based on the provided structure and fill in the necessary calculations step-by-step.

Given information:
- **2023 Sales Volume (A)**: 15,840 units
- **2024 Planned Sales Volume (B)**: 27,720 units
- **Inventory as of April 2024 (C)**: 3,960 units
- **Recall cost per unit (8,000 yen)**
- **Reduction Rate (25%)**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of units subject to recall (NR)
NR = A - C  
NR = 15,840 - 3,960  
NR = 11,880 units

### Step 2: Calculate the recall cost (X)
X = Recall cost per unit * NR  
X = 8,000 * 11,880  
X = 94,400,000 yen

### Step 3: Calculate the total planned sales volume after recall (considering the reduction)
Total Planned Sales Volume = B + C  
Total Planned Sales Volume = 27,720 + 3,960  
Total Planned Sales Volume = 31,680 units

Post-recall Sales Volume (N) = Total Planned Sales Volume * (1 - Reduction Rate)  
N = 31,680 * (1 - 0.25)  
N = 31,680 * 0.75  
N = 23,760 units

### Step 4: Calculate the recall price (P)
Assuming E to be the estimated revenue for the class of 2024 subject to recall, E can initially be derived from:

E = 1,980 million yen (presumably from the ZX-1000 revenue)  
Thus:
P = E / (B + C)  
P = 1,980,000,000 yen / 31,680  
P ≈ 62,500.00 yen/unit

### Step 5: Calculate the decrease in revenue (Y)
Decrease in Revenue (Y) = P * (B + C) * Reduction Rate  
Y = 62,500 * 31,680 * 0.25  
Y = 62,500 * 7,920  
Y = 493,750,000 yen

### Step 6: Calculate the total loss amount (L)
L = X + Y  
L = 94,400,000 + 493,750,000  
L = 588,150,000 yen

### Step 7: Revised Planned Revenue for the model subject to recall (E')
E' = E - L  
E' = 1,980,000,000 - 588,150,000  
E' = 1,391,850,000 yen

### Step 8: Revised Planned Revenue for this fiscal year (D')
Revised Planned revenue for the fiscal year (D') = D - L  
Assuming D = 2,772 million yen (D as provided in the document which seems to be revenue for this fiscal year), thus:  
D' = 2,772,000,000 - 588,150,000  
D' = 2,183,850,000 yen

### Summary of Results
- **Units subject to recall (NR)**: 11,880 units
- **Total Recall Cost (X)**: 94,400,000 yen
- **Post-recall Sales Volume (N)**: 23,760 units
- **Recall Price (P)**: 62,500.00 yen/unit
- **Decrease in Revenue (Y)**: 493,750,000 yen
- **Total Loss Amount (L)**: 588,150,000 yen
- **Revised Planned Revenue for Recall Model (E')**: 1,391,850,000 yen
- **Revised Planned Revenue for Fiscal Year (D')**: 2,183,850,000 yen

4. **Cost Calculations**:
   - Several formulas are detailed for calculating net results:
     - **Total Recall Cost (X)**: It is derived from the number of recalled units and the cost per unit.
     - **Revenue Loss (L)**: This consists of the total recall cost plus any additional revenue lost due to decreased sales volume.

5. **Adjusted Revenue Figures**:
   - The revised sales revenue for the model impacted by the recall has been recalculated to account for the losses incurred.
   - The report emphasizes the need for adjustments in sales projections for the current fiscal year, taking into consideration the financial ramifications of the recall.
