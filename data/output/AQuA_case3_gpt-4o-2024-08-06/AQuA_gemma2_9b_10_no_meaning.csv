There's a lot of information given here, so let's eat slow here.
Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).
Now, come next year, or his second year at this psychology school, he's technically 23 years old. To find out the second year's grade, we want to double his age PLUS half of his previous grade.
Well, his second year is then going to be 23(2) + 22 = 68.
Now let's tackle the main question: what's his grade going to be the third year?
Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)

## Question
In a <r004> <r016> <r001>, we <r012> five cards with five <r006> <r019> <r017> on them. We will distribute these five cards among three <r009>: all could <r011> in any <r009>, or they could be <r002> up in any way among the <r009>s. Then in each <r008>, we <r010> the <r022> of all the cards in that <r009>: that is the “<r017>” of the <r009>. An <r009> containing no cards <r012> the <r017> 1. We then <r023> the three <r009> <r017> in <r018>, from <r014> to <r013>, and that is our <r024>. How <r015> <r006> W <r024>s can be <r021> by this <r020>?
