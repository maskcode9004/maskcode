Time to paint each wall as given in problem:
AC = 4 hours
BC = 2 hours
AB = 6 hours
Since he works at constant rate and it takes him twice as long to paint AC compared to BC
AC=2BC

Total # of arrangements of 6 people in a row is 6!;
Now, let's find # of arrangements where C and D as well as A and B ARE seated next to each other. Consider them as a single unit: {AB}, {CD}, E, F. Now, these 4 units can be arranged in 4!, but we should multiply this number by 2*2 as A and B, as well as C and D within their unit can be arranged in two ways: {AB} or {BA}, and {CD} or {DC}. Hence total for this case is 4!*2*2;
So, {# of arrangements}={total}-{restriction}=6!-4!*2*2=624.

Since co-efficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola will be downward facing. So the parabola and the x axis will enclose some points where the y-values of the parabola are positive.
When x = 1, y = 5 lies on the parabola, so (1, 6) will not be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.
When x = 3, y = 9 lies on the parabola, so (3, 11) will not be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.
When x = 5, y = 5 lies on the parabola, so (5, 4) will be enclosed by the parabola and x axis.

Since <r008> of x^2 is <r015>, the parabola will be <r010> <r012>. So the parabola and the x <r006> will <r011> some points where the <r027>-values of the parabola are <r019>.
When x = 1, <r027> = 5 <r014> on the parabola, so (1, 6) will not be <r011>d b<r027> the parabola and x <r006>.
When x = 3, <r027> = 9 <r014> on the parabola, so (3, 11) will not be <r011>d b<r027> the parabola and x <r006>.
When x = 5, <r027> = 5 <r014> on the parabola, so (5, 4) will be <r011>d b<r027> the parabola and x <r006>.
The answer is <r002>

There's a lot of information given here, so let's eat slow here.
Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).
Now, come next year, or his second year at this psychology school, he's technically 23 years old. To find out the second year's grade, we want to double his age PLUS half of his previous grade.
Well, his second year is then going to be 23(2) + 22 = 68.
Now let's tackle the main question: what's his grade going to be the third year?
Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)

Cool question!
There's a lot of information given here, so let's eat slow here.
Joey scores a 44 at the end of his first year. That means that he's currently 22 years old (since given per instruction, after the first year one's grade is determined by doubling his/her age).
Now, come next year, or his second year at this psychology school, he's technically 23 years old. To find out the second year's grade, we want to double his age PLUS half of his previous grade.
Well, his second year is then going to be 23(2) + 22 = 68.
Now let's tackle the main question: what's his grade going to be the third year?
Well, he will be at an age of 22 on his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year's grade, you're going to double his age (24x2), plus half of his previous year's grade (as calculated for his second year, his grade is 68; therefore, 68/2)
Having said that, the final answer would be 24(2) + 68/2 = 48 + 34 = 82 --> (C)

Well, he will be at an <r006> of 22 <r035> his third year at this school. Again, to find out his third year<r008> grade, you're going to double his <r006> (24x2), plus half of his previous year<r008> grade (as calculated for his sec<r035>d year, his grade is 68; <r048>, 68/2)
Having said that, the final answer would be <r001>) + 68/2 = 48 + 34 = 82 --> (<r009>)

The question:In the x<r041>-plane, the points P=(c, d), (c, -d), and (-c, -d) are three <r037> of a certain <r034>.If c < 0 and d > 0,which of the following points is in the <r032> quadrant as the fourth <r037> of the <r034>?
I <r020> the <r036> part in red. It seems c is anegativenumber and d is a positive number. This means
<r009> #1 = (c, d) is in QII (<r035> is, negative x and positive <r041>)
<r009> #2 = (c, -d) is in QIII (<r035> is, both x<r041> negative)
<r009> #3 = (-c, -d) is in QIV (<r035> is <r041> is negative, but x is positive)
That means the last <r037> should be in the first quadrant --- the onl<r041> first quadrant point is (5, 3), answer =E.

When it comes to averages, we know thataverage value = (sum of n values)/n
We can rewrite this into a useful formula:sum of n values = (average value)(n)
The average of five integers is 56
So, the sum of ALL 5 integers = (56)(5) =280
The average of three of the integers is 65
So, the sum of the 3 integers = (59)(3) =177
So, the sum of the 2 REMAINING integers =280-177=103
If the sum of the 2 REMAINING integers =103, and we want to minimize one value, we must MAXIMIZE the other value.
100 is the maximum value so let 1 integer = 100, which means the other must equal 3

the nubmer which when divided by 7 leaves remainder 1 should be of the form 7k+1
this number when divided by 3 leaves remainder 2.
so,
(7k+1)-2 should be divisible by 3 or 7k-1 should be divisible by 3.
we now put the values of k starting from 0 to find first number divisible by 3
we find 1st number at k= 1

## Question
In a certain mathematical activity, we have five cards with five different prime numbers on them. We will distribute these five cards among three envelope: all could go in any envelope, or they could be broken up in any way among the envelopes. Then in each envelop, we find the product of all the cards in that envelope: that is the “number” of the envelope. An envelope containing no cards has the number 1.23. We then put the three envelope numbers in order, from lowest to highest, and that is our set. How many different W sets can be produced by this process?
